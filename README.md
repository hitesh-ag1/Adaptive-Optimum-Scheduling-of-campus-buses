The project will be addressing Goal 11 of the UN sustainable development goals which is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
This theme will be applied to the NTU community and the project will focus on solving the problem with the scheduling of campus buses with utmost practicality and scalability so that the solution could be implemented in the real world. 
To be more specific, the projectâ€™s aim will be to minimize waiting time, fuel wastage and overcrowding of buses in peak hours.

The solution will focus on solving the problem by developing a:
1. Backend computer vision system inside the buses which detects the number of people entering and leaving the buses.
2. Frontend application for users showing the crowd in the incoming buses so that if they are full users can find an alternative.
3. Frontend application for bus drivers to make sure that they are all equidistant from each other in a particular loop and will notify drivers to rest and not waste fuel when there is not enough demand.
4. Backend database which can be used in the future for predicting demand of buses using machine learning techniques.
